										<h2>Lessons learnt and key outcomes</h2>
									</header>
									<p>By the units mentioned below, I learnt to understand the fundamentals of information systems and critically assess their features and learn from case studies involving systems failures to design purpose-built, successful object-oriented systems via UML diagrams. Such charts include sequence, activity, entity relationship, and class diagrams. Thereafter, I learnt to appreciate the object-oriented programming (OOP)-related principles and leveraged them to develop information systems in both Python and SQL, including a doctor’s surgery-related application. Throughout these endeavours, I learnt how to design and develop object-oriented systems to streamline and inform business decisions.</p>

											<p>During this unit, I had the chance to apply OOP-related principles in Python further by carrying out coding exercises on encapsulation, polymorphism, including operator overloading for changing the behaviour of built-in Python functions to suit specific custom purposes, and using private (class) attributes and methods. Building on my Java-related knowledge about getters and setters, I had the opportunity to create them in Python in two ways, i.e., using property decorators and via the ‘property’ built-in function. The codes I developed throughout these exercises can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below.</p>

Whilst the class diagram represents all classes in the proposed software system, the sequence diagram illustrates the main steps involved in the process a patient must follow to be able to book an appointment with a doctor. Instead, the activity diagram shows the required checks and operations that a receptionist may perform to book an appointment for a patient.</p>

I also completed an assignment on a software system design to help in managing self-service checkouts at a supermarket, which involves a related UML class diagram, including its classes and their relationships. Click on 'LEARN MORE' below to view this assignment. In this instance, I learnt how to wear the user’s (customer’s) hat and empathise with their pain points to drive the design of the information system based on their needs and operations involved when scanning items at a self-service checkout. This way of thinking enabled me to design the system such that the customer’s experience is as seamless as possible, from the start to the end of this process. Furthermore, I appreciated the lecturer’s feedback and leveraged it as an external reviewer to improve the clarity of the relationships represented on the class diagram, as demonstrated in subsequent units’ artefacts, such as in unit 8.</p>

Furthermore, as an assignment, given a UML class diagram, I implemented a Python-based software system focused on leveraging OOP-related design to help in managing a doctor’s surgery’s appointment scheduling’s and prescriptions’ workflows, which can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below. In this instance, I practised further on how to understand the patient’s (user’s) journey through the process of booking an appointment and requesting a prescription at a doctor’s surgery. By leveraging the UML class diagram with the expected classes and their relationships, I could appreciate the various interactions and constraints involved in such workflows, and how they can be represented via an object-oriented design and implementation. Thus, I designed the application to leverage OOP-related best practices to streamline the user’s experience and ensure all business and technical requirements were strictly adhered to.</p>
