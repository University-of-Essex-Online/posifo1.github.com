										<h2>Lessons learnt and key outcomes</h2>

									</header>

									<p>Via the units mentioned below, I learnt to appreciate and apply the fundamentals of software engineering best practices and project management
										frameworks, critically assess their suitability throughout the SDLC and learn from case studies involving software engineering project-related
										failures to devise, manage, and deliver successful software engineering-related projects adopting robust and modern principles, best practices,
										and methodologies. These techniques involved appropriate definition of requirements as per the key user personas, tailored design to meet their
										prioritised needs and wants, robust design, software implementation and testing, gathering their early feedback, and enhancing the software
										throughout the SDLC, including via user acceptance testing (UAT). Furthermore, I learnt and applied various project management methodologies in
										traditional and modern SDLC models, such as TOGAF and Agile (both Scrum for delivery implementations and Kanban for fast-paced
										discovery-/hypothesis testing-related work), to build a working prototype of a remote-controlled race car-related game as a software application.
										In this team project, I learnt the importance of leveraging the team members' passion, skills, and expertise to design and deliver a software
										systems to meet key users' requirements whilst promoting diversity and inclusion in car racing, and complying with applicable data privacy
										regulations considering the storage and processing of required personal data, such as the European Union (EU)’s General Data
										Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>

												<h3>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h3>

											</header>

											<p>Research aims to explore, describe, and explain a situation or topic. The scientific method is a key approach to guide the
												research endeavours and investigation in a cohesive and empirical direction. Thus, it involves observing, formulating hypotheses,
												reasoning, and testing. Reasoning can be deductive or inductive, and either methods lead to inference, i.e., reaching a conclusion
												that is grounded on reasoning. Nevertheless, research does not only involve scientific investigations, but also balancing ethics, especially
												when people are involved. To understand and appreciate the importance of ethics in research, an ACM case study on "Dark UX Patterns"
												was evaluated. You can download my post as a part of a group discussion by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below.</p>

												<h3>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>

											</header>

											<p>Defining the focus of the research is time-consuming, but pivotal to set the research up for success.
												A research idea is initially formulated and then specific research questions are derived, which
												should be leveraged to write a research proposal. As a part of this proposal, critically reviewing
												the literature to understand the current knowledge in the chosen field and identify gaps to fill wih own
												research is fundamental to add value to knowledge. You can download my responses to my peers during
												the first collaborative discussion by clicking ‘LEARN MORE’ below.</p>

											<p>In this unit, I learnt various research designs (exploratory and conclusive, including descriptive research) and methods
												(qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research). The focus of the research I aim to pursue is conclusive and quantitative,
												thus focusing to analyse data quantitatively and leveraging such numerical insights to inform the delineation and selection
												of a course of action to predict medication safety.
												In this week, I had the chance to ponder on the discussion with my peers during the previous two units and provided a
												summary post, which can be downloaded by clicking ‘LEARN MORE’ below.</p>
