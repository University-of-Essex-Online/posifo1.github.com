										<h2>Lessons learnt and key outcomes</h2>

									</header>

									<p>By the units mentioned below, I understood the fundamentals of secure software development and critically assess its components and learn from case studies involving cryptographic failures to design secure, purpose-built, industry-grade, successful software systems adopting security-related principles, best practices, and methodologies. These techniques involved appropriate gathering of requirements, analysis, design, software implementation and testing for secure software development. Thereafter, I learnt to appreciate related achitectural principles and leverage them in traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, such as TOGAF and Agile, to build a secure, CRUD-functional internet forensics-related command line interface (CLI)-based application. Throughout these endeavours, I learnt how to design and develop secure software systems to streamline and inform business decisions involving handling personal data whilst adhering to data privacy regulations, such as the European Union (EU)’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>

												<h3>Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development</h3>

											</header>

											<p>Trends and advances in secure software development were reviewed within both academic research and industry, such as Fog Computing, the Internet of Things, and Cyber Physical Systems, encompassing several areas, from design to implementation, programming languages and operating systems. The security issues associated with the aforementioned systems were considered and strategies to mitigate them were investigated. The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate on whether microservices and microkernels are the future was discussed and I provided my views on it in <a href=" https://github.com/marianne-manaog/ssdcs-module-activities/blob/main/collaborative_discussions/Unit%2011%20%E2%80%93%20Debate%20on%20Microservices%20and%20Microkernels.docx">this post</a>. As a part of a team, in the repository that can be accessed by clicking ‘LEARN MORE’ below, I was one of the main contributors developing a secure CRUD-functional CLI-based application, implementing CLI-based entry points to perform CRUD operations, a centralised global logger to ensure full application’s auditability and monitoring, extensive user inputs’ validation along with appropriate exception handling and logging, multi-threading to enable parallelisation of the requests thus allowing two or further concurrent users to consume it, automated code quality checks and linting, unit and integration testing of the main applications’ functionalities, including CRUD operations, encryption, and user inputs’ validation. Furthermore, I had created a conda virtual environment for us to work on the same environment in Python with the same dependencies, as well as scanned them to understand if they had any security vulnerabilities and created a Python package out of our application that can be installed via pip. I was also the main reviewer of my team members’ pull requests, aiming to achieve a high-quality and secure software as per the assignment’s specifications.</p>
